# @fgladisch/pi-bash-approval

## Unreleased

- Ignore heredoc bodies during command splitting so commit messages and other literal heredoc content inside command substitutions are not treated as executable command text.
- Evaluate command substitutions inside assignment tokens by their inner command so approval suggestions no longer offer invalid flags like `-d ...):*` for commands such as `tmp=$(mktemp -d ...)`, and assignment-prefixed commands also check setup substitutions like `FOO=$(./setup) npm test`.

## 0.2.2

- Ignore redirection-only shell group segments when suggesting bash approval rules.
- Avoid splitting bash approval command chains on separators inside command substitutions.

## 0.2.1

- Ignore shell condition-test segments (`[ ... ]`, `[[ ... ]]`, `test ...`) during approval matching so prompts no longer suggest invalid rules like `[ -f:*`.
- Move extension settings/split parser types from `extensions/utils.ts` to `extensions/types.ts` for clearer type ownership.

## 0.2.0

- Migrate configuration to `~/.pi/agent/.bash-approval` (rules) and `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (`bashApproval.splitChains`) instead of `bash-approval.json`.
- Improve shell-chain parsing by ignoring control/declaration scaffolding (`if/then/fi`, `for/do/done`, assignment-only segments) and evaluating real command segments.
- Update reload/help text and non-interactive block reason to point to new config paths.
